          <h3>Why I chose Archery</h3>
          <p>As long as I can remember I've always had an interest in "wierd" things but cartoons and
          comics drew my attention to archery and the TV show 'Arrow' made me want to do archery more
          than anything. Living in Cape Town, South Africa, archery is a rare sport and the clubs that was
          arround then where too far from me and as a kid I coudn't go to those clubs for those reasons and once
          I found a club  near me I joined that club.

          <h3>My Journey in Archery</h3>
          <p>
          In 2016 a friend came into my life, little did I know that it would
          change everythng. He introduced me to an archery club that wass in its starting up
          and in October that year I enrolled to the club's first beginers course, 4 years later
          the club has almost 250 members with more people interested this is a lot
          cocidering the fact that in South Africa, where I'm from, archery is not that popluar.
          </p>
          <p>In 2017 I bought my first bow set though my club. <img src="IMG_2586.jpg" alt="my first bow">
            As there's no archery retailer in South Africa the club
          used one of its contacts that got our bows imporded from South Korea. It was a 22 lbs bow from the company
          Cartel.
          In January 2020 I upgraded some parts of my bow and now is 30 lbs. </p>
