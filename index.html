                 Archery is a relaxing sport that leads back the way
                to the late Paleolithic period about 10,000 BC where archery by the Egyptians
                and surrounding areas was used for hunting.
                At about the same time archery was used by China
                in the Shang dynasty to help fight their enemies and thereafter was used as entertainment
                 in the Zhou (Chou) dynasty as the
                nobles attended tournaments that was accompanied by music.

              <div class="grid-item-history">Throughout history the art of archery was used to fight the enemy and
                was very helpful in both medium and longer range warfare. The bow was more than just a weapon,
                they became one with the soiled that used it as over time archers learnt exactly how their bow
                fired and what their limit was as well as the limit of the bow</div>

                and in both cases theres a huge variaty  of styles available, much more than there was in the
                past, and are classed as these four main types: recurve bows , longbow, crossbow and compound bow.</div>
