                <p> Archery is a relaxing sport that leads back the way
                to the late Paleolithic period about 10,000 BC where archery by the Egyptians
                and surrounding areas was used for hunting.
                At about the same time archery was used by China
                in the Shang dynasty to help fight their enemies and thereafter was used as entertainment
                 in the Zhou (Chou) dynasty as the
                nobles attended tournaments that was accompanied by music.
              </p>
                <p>Throughout history the art of archery was used to fight the enemy and
                  was very helpful in both medium and longer range warfare. The archers beacme one with their bows and
                  learnt how to perfect a shot fired from thier bow both on the move and when they where satationary.

              <h4>Different Styles of bows</h4>
              <p>There are many different styes of bows in the world but all of them fall into one of four groups and they are:
                 crossbow recurvebows, compound bows and longbow</p>
                 This is the list of different styles:<ul>
                   <li>Olympic Recurve: These bows are the more common in archery clubs and stores around the world and in the most common
                     type of bow used the the olympic games.</li>
                   <li>Longbow: This is an older style bow, whichis made of a single pice of wood or laminated wood(layers of wood) and is
                     shaped and treated to perfection.</li>
                   <li>Triditional Turkish (recurve): This bow stlye was used a lot in the past and hepled the Ottoman Empire become victorious.
                     These bows are still used today by archers and horse-back archers a like. </li>
                   <li>PVC bows: Normaly shaped and bent by heating up a single pice of PVC pipe and molding it into the correct shape. </li>
                   <li>Compound bows: Mostly used for hunting as the pullies gives an advantage to how long you can keep a baw at full draw
                    and the pullies can lesten the amount of force needed to pull to full draw.</li>
                    <li>Chinese and Mongolian bow: They are very similar and are both equally as powerful.</li>
                    <li>Crossbows: These are super powerful and extreamly accurate as this has a trigger to release and shoot a broader
                      and shorter arrow, bolt, that can handle the force at which the arrow is released.</li>
