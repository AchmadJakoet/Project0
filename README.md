# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Ive been an archer for almost four years now and my love for the sport continues to grow, thus the topic I chose for this project is Archery. I chose this as it is my greatest passion. All the facts I've either comes from knowledge that I've learnt from more experienced archers of from highly credited archery websites.

Index.html is the first webpage that contains some history, facts and a general introduction to the sport. A pic of a set of arrows in the bullseye is included and a gif showing the accuracy that an archer has when shooting.
