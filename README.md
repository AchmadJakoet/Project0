Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Ive been an archer for almost four years now and my love for the sport continues to grow, thus the topic I chose for this project is Archery. I chose this as it is my greatest passion. All the facts I've either comes from knowledge that I've learnt from more experienced archers of from highly credited archery websites.

index.html is the first webpage that contains some history, facts and a general introduction to the sport. A pic of a set of arrows in the bullseye is included and a gif showing the accuracy that an archer has when shooting.

moreonarchery.html is the second webpage the contains a break down of each main type of bow. This webpage also contains the pros and cons of each bow type as well as pictures of the parts of each bow.

mythsandlegends.html is the third webpage contains information about myths that people think when they think of archery. This webpage also contains some legends when thinking of archery.

Archerytome.html is the final webpage and contains information about me and the club that I shoot at in South Africa. This webpage also contains a link to the club's instagram page and an image of my very first bow that I bought.
